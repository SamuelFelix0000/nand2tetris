/** 
This is a simple program that allows you to draw diagrams 
on the screen, using WSAD keys to control the drawing pen's movement.
To start drawing, press E
If you want to lift the pen and start drawing at the different
location, press F to lift the pen up (disable drawing temporarily)
To reset everything, press R
To exit the program, press Q
Note: Do not hold the keys for a long time. Just press the keys once and lift you fingers up.
-Just give me 60/100, I only want to pass this assignment, thanks :)
